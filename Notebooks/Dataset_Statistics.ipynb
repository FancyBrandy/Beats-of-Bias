This song is built around a guitar hook reminiscent of spy film scores and surf music. It has a twelve bar blues progression, using only three chords until the coda.The eleven cries of \"Batman!\" are sung by a chorus of four tenors and four sopranos (performed by The Ron Hicklin Singers). A long held myth purports that the chorus is actually a group of horns. Adam West's book Back to the Batcave also fuels this rumor by claiming the chorus is instrumental, not vocal. However, Neal Hefti, the writer of the theme, stated that the chorus was made up of eight singers, one of whom jokingly wrote on his part, \"word and music by Neal Hefti\". TV's Biggest Hits by Jon Burlingame, published in 1996, focuses exclusively on TV theme songs, and includes an interview with Hefti about the creation of the Batman theme song. According to Burlingame, the song consisted of \"bass guitar, low brass and percussion to create a driving rhythm, while an eight-voice chorus sings 'Batman!' in harmony with the trumpets.\"In addition to Neal Hefti's original version, and the television soundtrack version by Nelson Riddle, versions were covered by The Marketts (single \"Batman Theme\" and album The Batman Theme by The Marketts), The Ventures (The Ventures Play the \"Batman\" Theme, Dolton BST8042, 3/1966), Al Hirt, The Standells and actor/musician David McCallum.The song has been widely parodied in the decades since its debut. The theme has been re-recorded by dozens of artists, including Link Wray, Voivod, The Jam, and The Who.   \n","1992184

Theme\", the title song of the 1966 Batman TV series, was composed by Neal Hefti. This song is built around a guitar hook reminiscent of spy film scores and surf music. It has a twelve bar blues progression, using only three chords until the coda.The eleven cries of \"Batman!\" are sung by a chorus of four tenors and four sopranos (performed by The Ron Hicklin Singers). A long held myth purports that the chorus is actually a group of horns. Adam West's book Back to the Batcave also fuels this rumor by claiming the chorus is instrumental, not vocal. However, Neal Hefti, the writer of the theme, stated that the chorus was made up of eight singers, one of whom jokingly wrote on his part, \"word and music by Neal Hefti\". TV's Biggest Hits by Jon Burlingame, published in 1996, focuses exclusively on TV theme songs, and includes an interview with Hefti about the creation of the Batman theme song. According to Burlingame, the song consisted of \"bass guitar, low brass and percussion to create a driving rhythm, while an eight-voice chorus sings 'Batman!' in harmony with the trumpets.\"In addition to Neal Hefti's original version, and the television soundtrack version by Nelson Riddle, versions were covered by The Marketts (single \"Batman Theme\" and album The Batman Theme by The Marketts), The Ventures (The Ventures Play the \"Batman\" Theme, Dolton BST8042, 3/1966), Al Hirt, The Standells and actor/musician David McCallum.The song has been widely parodied in the decades since its debut.

In the 1960s, she married jazz musician Ragnar Fredriksson and had two children, [a325133] and Ann Lise-Lotte Fredriksson. The couple separated after a few years. During Dagen-H in 1967, she won EMI's talent competition, \\\"New Faces\\\" and first appeared on Swedish television, as she sang \\\"En ledig dag\\\", which was her first single released by His Master's Voice, a week after Dagen-H. Frida was a struggling singer prior to the formation of ABBA due to her fourth placement in Melodifestivalen 1969, with a song \\\"Härlig är vår jord\\\". Nonetheless, Frida recorded singles for EMI consistently, which led her to appear on Swedish television and cabarets, despite that neither of the other songs, charted or only a few songs were circulated in the Swedish radio or sales charts, until she met future bandmate and husband [a69873] the same year, who would later propelled her to sing other genres beyond her jazz songs, with her first No. 1 hit in the Swedish radio charts, \\\"Min egen stad\\\", released in 1971 as the B-side to \\\"En gång är ingen gång\\\".\\r\\rA year later, in 1972, Frida was signed to [l40813] and recorded her first single for the label \\\"Man vill ju leva lite dessemellan\\\", which was her second No. 1 hit in Svensktoppen; ABBA would be formed that same year. During ABBA's recording session of \\\"Waterloo\\\" and their early success after winning the Eurovision Song Contest of 1974, the production of her first solo album for Polar, \\\"Frida Ensam\\\" commenced and took one and a quarter year to finish the recording of the album. \\\"Frida Ensam\\\" was released in November 1975 in Scandinavia. Her single, Fernando (later recorded in English by ABBA), and the album reached to the top 10 in Svensktoppen. \\r\\rDuring ABBA's middle to final years, Frida married Andersson in 1978, and later divorced him in 1981, due to multiple disputes. This led her to collaborate with Genesis drummer and singer [a101028] with her famous album, \\\"Something's Going On\\\", in 1982. With her single, \\\"I Know There's Something Going On\\\", the single reached to the top fives in most of Europe's weekly charts, while in some countries such as the United Kingdom, and the United States, it reached lower than the top fives, depending on the quantity of the record chart list, most notably No. 13 on Billboard's Hot 100. \\\"Something's Going On\\\", as an album, reached to one of the top 40 in Europe's country-varied weekly charts, while in the United States, it reached No. 41 in Billboard's 200. Other singles from \\\"Something's Going On\\\" followed, but did not match the success as her lead single did.\\r\\rIn 1984, Frida released her album \\\"Shine\\\", produced by [a50809]. Unlike her previous album, it was a moderate success in Europe, reaching the Top 10, and Top 20 on some countries such as Sweden, Norway, Belgium, and the Netherlands, but not in particular countries, especially the United Kingdom, which reached No. 67. The album, \\\"Shine\\\", also debuted her songwriting such as \\\"Don't Do It\\\", \\\"I Don't Wanna Be Alone\\\" (unreleased, exists only as a bootleg), and \\\"That's Tough\\\" (non-album track), and spawned singles, \\\"Shine/That's Tough\\\", \\\"Come To Me (I Am Woman)/Slowly\\\", \\\"Heart of the Country/Slowly\\\", and \\\"Twist in the Dark/Come To Me (I Am Woman)\\\". She withdrew from music business for a while, as a solo singer after \\\"Shine\\\" was released.\\r\\rA few years later, starting in 1991, Frida became an environmentalist, appearing on fairs and galas, and formed a short lived supergroup, \\\"Artister för Miljö\\\", to raise awareness of the environment. Five years later, she marked her music comeback with her album \\\"Djupa andetag\\\". The album featured her singles, \\\"Även en blomma\\\", \\\"Ögonen\\\", and \\\"Alla mina bästa år\\\", as well as her self-composed album track, \\\"Kvinnor som springer\\\". Frida became a princess through her marriage to Prince Heinrich Ruzzo Reuss (of Plauen) in 1992. The marriage lasted until Reuss died of lymphoma in 1999. \\r\\rSince 1987, Frida has appeared as a guest singer, most notably with Swedish duo [a51226], Deep Purple keyboardist [a262410], and [a2553309].\\rFrida was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of ABBA in 2010.\\r\\r\",\"nameVariations\":[\"Frida ABBA\",\"Fridda\"],\"urls\":[\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9I2NnelIPAgtjkB-j7Wnjg\",\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anni-Frid_Lyngstad\",\"http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=49655280183\\u0026v=info\"],\"urlEquipBoard\":\"http://equipboard.com/pros/anni-frid-lyngstad\",\"equipments\":[],\"subject\":[\"Norwegian emigrants to Sweden\",\"People from Ballangen\",\"House of Reuss\",\"1945 births\",\"Norwegian people of German descent\",\"Living people\",\"Swedish expatriates in Switzerland\",\"ABBA members\",\"Swedish mezzo-sopranos\",\"Swedish pop singers\",\"Princesses of Reuss\",\"English-language singers of Sweden\",\"Swedish female singers\"],\"birthDate\":\"1945-11-15\",\"dbp_abstract\":\"Anni-Frid Synni, Princess Reuss of Plauen (German: Anni-Frid Synni, Prinzessin Reuss von Plauen; born Anni-Frid Synni Lyngstad, pronounced [ˈlʏŋstɑːd], 15 November 1945), widely known as Frida Lyngstad or by just the mononym Frida, is a Norwegian-born Swedish pop and jazz singer.

Called the King of Pop, his contributions to music and dance, along with his publicized personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades.The eighth child of the Jackson family, he debuted on the professional music scene along with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5 in 1964, and began his solo career in 1971. In the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in popular music. The music videos for his songs, including those of \\\"Beat It\\\", \\\"Billie Jean\\\", and \\\"Thriller\\\", were credited with breaking down racial barriers and with transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. The popularity of these videos helped to bring the then-relatively-new television channel MTV to fame. With videos such as \\\"Black or White\\\" and \\\"Scream\\\", he continued to innovate the medium throughout the 1990s, as well as forging a reputation as a touring solo artist. Through stage and video performances, Jackson popularized a number of complicated dance techniques, such as the robot and the moonwalk, to which he gave the name. His distinctive sound and style has influenced numerous artists of various music genres.Jackson's 1982 album Thriller is the best-selling album of all time. His other albums, including Off the Wall (1979), Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), and HIStory (1995), also rank among the world's best-selling albums. Jackson is one of the few artists to have been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice. He was also inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame and the Dance Hall of Fame as the first and only dancer from pop and rock music. His other achievements include multiple Guinness World Records, 13 Grammy Awards, the Grammy Legend Award, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award, 26 American Music Awards—more than any other artist—including the \\\"Artist of the Century\\\" and \\\"Artist of the 1980s\\\", 13 number-one singles in the United States during his solo career,—more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era—and estimated sales of over 400 million records worldwide. Jackson has won hundreds of awards, making him the most awarded recording artist in the history of popular music. He became the first artist in history to have a top ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades when \\\"Love Never Felt So Good\\\" reached number nine on May 21, 2014. Jackson traveled the world attending events honoring his humanitarianism, and, in 2000, the Guinness World Records recognized him for supporting 39 charities, more than any other entertainer.Aspects of Michael Jackson's personal life, including his changing appearance, personal relationships, and behavior, generated controversy. In the mid-1990s, he was accused of child sexual abuse, but the civil case was settled out of court for an undisclosed amount and no formal charges were brought. In 2005, he was tried and acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges after the jury found him not guilty on all counts. While preparing for his comeback concert series titled This Is It, Jackson died of acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication on June 25, 2009, after suffering from cardiac arrest. The Los Angeles County Coroner ruled his death a homicide, and his personal physician, Conrad Murray, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Jackson's death triggered a global outpouring of grief, and a live broadcast of his public memorial service was viewed around the world. Forbes currently ranks Jackson as the top-earning dead celebrity, a title held for a fifth consecutive year, with $140 million in earnings.\"},\n",":\"fae00257-e2a1-46f9-a29d-e68cf8df20fd\",\"name\":\"Reynaud Jones\",\"instruments\":[],\"begin\":\"\",\"end\":\"\",\"ended\":false,\"disambiguation\":\"\",\"type\":\"member of band\",\"gender\":null,\"urlEquipBoard\":\"\"}]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Album dataset's columns\n","\n","['_id',\n"," 'genre',\n"," 'id_artist',\n"," 'length',\n"," 'name',\n"," 'publicationDate',\n"," 'rdf',\n"," 'title',\n"," 'urlAlbum',\n"," 'urlAllmusic',\n"," 'urlAmazon',\n"," 'urlDiscogs',\n"," 'urlITunes',\n"," 'urlMusicBrainz',\n"," 'urlSpotify',\n"," 'urlWikipedia',\n"," 'id_album_deezer',\n"," 'urlDeezer',\n"," 'cover',\n"," 'cover.big',\n"," 'cover.medium',\n"," 'cover.small',\n"," 'cover.standard',\n"," 'cover.xl',\n"," 'deezerFans',\n"," 'explicitLyrics',\n"," 'upc',\n"," 'barcode',\n"," 'country',\n"," 'dateRelease',\n"," 'disambiguation',\n"," 'id_album_musicbrainz',\n"," 'language',\n"," 'id_album_discogs']\n","\n","# Albums are not needed.
